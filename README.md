# Number-guessing-game

A simple number guessing game where a user tries to guess a secret number correctly. The score is set to 20 in the beginning and it's reduced by one after every wrong guess. If the secret number correctly guessed, the UI changes color to indicate a correct guess and the user can reset and begin playing again.
